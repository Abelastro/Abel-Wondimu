Welcome to My GitHub! ðŸ‘‹
=====================================
I'm Abel Wondimu, a dedicated developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions in web design, computer vision, and robotics. With a foundation in Python, JavaScript, and C++, I build responsive web applications using React and Tailwind CSS, develop cutting-edge computer vision models with OpenCV and PyTorch, and design autonomous systems using ROS and Arduino. My projects blend creativity and technical expertise to tackle real-world challenges, from crafting stunning user interfaces to enabling robots to navigate complex environments. Iâ€™m driven by a love for learning and pushing the boundaries of technology, whether itâ€™s implementing YOLO for real-time object detection or building a ROS-based robotic navigation system. Explore my repositories to see my work in action, including portfolio websites, object detection systems, and robotic prototypes.
